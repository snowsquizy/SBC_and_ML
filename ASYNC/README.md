# Python Code for Asyncrhonous ML

## Tic Tac Toe Programming Code is listed above .

## The MINST Programming code used was from the [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_deep.py) Tutorials

​
## Code used for Asynchronous Training of two Machine Learners
​
The performance of this when compared to the Synchronous Training meant this was used for testing and reported on.
​
The difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous is best shown in the following graphic from the original tesnorflow academic paper
